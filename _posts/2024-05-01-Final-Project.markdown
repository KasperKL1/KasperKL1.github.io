This website will explore reported car accidents in NYC in the years 2012 to 2023, and see if there are any locations that might be more endangering than others. The website will mainly focus on <strong>weather</strong> as a contributing factor, and examine if there are trends and coorelations to be spotted in accidents happening and weather conditions.
