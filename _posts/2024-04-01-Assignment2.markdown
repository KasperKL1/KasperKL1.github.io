We want to look at forgery/counterfeiting. Because this category seems to be decreasing rapidly in recent years. This could be due to the fact that documents are being digitalized more and more and therefore, these are not as easily forged as they were in the past.


We make a map of SF to show where the forgery/counterfeiting takes place.

# HEATMAP GOES HERE

From this heatmap we clearly see a decrease in occurences of forgery/counterfeiting over time. We see that the southern district has the highest denisty over time. From this map we can also see that the occurences of forgery/counterfeiting in the southern district are in fact happening in the financial area which can be seen on this map: (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SF_Financial_District_map.png)
