We want to look at forgery/counterfeiting. Because this category seems to be decreasing rapidly in recent years. This could be due to the fact that documents are being digitalized more and more and therefore, these are not as easily forged as they were in the past.


We make a map of SF to show where the forgery/counterfeiting takes place.

Here we see that the most forgeries take place in the Southern district.
